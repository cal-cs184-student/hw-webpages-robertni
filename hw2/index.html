		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we explored creating 3D images in a variety of ways. Firstly, we investigated Bezier curves and used linear interpolation to 
		get smooth curves between a set of control points. Next, we learned about triangle meshes and halfedges, which can be used to draw out 3D structures
		using a simple mesh of triangles. Throughout this process, I found it really interesting how we can simplify tasks that I would assume are extremely 
		difficult into simple data structures and methods. 

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		de Casteljau's algorithm is an algorithm that allows us to create Bezier curves using linear interpolation. Given a set of values 
		<i>t</i> in the interval [0,1], we can calculate <i>x(t)</i> values as follows:
		<center>
			<var>x<sub>i</sub>(t)</var> = (1-<var>t</var>)<var>p<sub>i</sub></var> - <var>tp<sub>i+1</sub></var>
		</center>
		<p>Recursively running this function will reduce the number of intermediate points by one in each step until you get an <i>x(t)</i>
		value that falls on your desired Bezier curve.</p>
		<p>
			In this part, I took a list of points to draw a Bezier curve from and created a function that would perform the above 
			equation recursively for some given <i>t</i> value. In this way, we find intermediate points based on this list of points and then we eventually 
			find the points on the Bezier curve when there is only one point left. This becomes one of the <i>x(t)</i> points to draw.
		</p>

		<p>We can see deCasteljau's algorithm used here to create Bezier curves.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		Taking the ideas from Part 1, de Casteljau's algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by finding Bezier curves in one dimension
		and then finding the Bezier curve that fits those curves in another dimension. In specific, I started with the simple evaluateStep()
		function similar to that in Part 1, where we take a set of points and run one step of the interpolation given some parameter, which we
		can call <i>u</i> in this case. If we do this continuously until we get one point from the interpolation, we will have found the point
		on the Bezier curve given that <i>u</i> value. If we do this for multiple sets of points, we now have multiple Bezier curves. Taking one
		point from each Bezier curve and forming a new set of points, I can now run another interpolation on these points with a second parameter
		<i>v</i>. Doing this for all indices of points in the Bezier curves (assuming all sets defining the Bezier curves have the same number of points) will yield a Bezier surface.

		<p>The figure below is an example of creating a teapot using this process.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		In this section, I created area-weighted vertex normals by using half-edges. From the given vertex, you can get the current 
		half-edge and then grab the edge from that half-edge. I updated the half-edge to half-edge->next() to get the next half-edge 
		and do this to get the three edges of one triangle. From these, we can get their lengths, which can be used to get the area of a triangle 
		using the equation below:
		<p></p>
		\[ Area = &radic;(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) \]
		<center>
			where \( s = (a + b + c) / 2 \)
		</center>
		<br>
		<pr>
			I multiply this area by the triangle face normal (halfedge->face()->normal()) and store the value. Once all faces adjacent to teh vertex have been 
			looped through, all the area x normal values are summed together and normalized (set to have length 1). This value is returned as the vertex normal.
		</pr>

		<p>The images below show an example of using no vertex normals (flat shading) vs. using vertex normals (Phong shading).</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>

			<figcaption>Me thinking I accounted for and updated all pointers of all elements and then realizing that I in fact did not account for and update all pointers of all elements.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p></p>
		To flip edges, I mainly followed the procedure as recommended in the project
		description. First, I defined every element in the mesh relevant to this flip, including ten halfedges, 
		four vertices, four edges (besides the input edge), and two faces. Then, I used setNeighbors() to reset all 
		of the neighboring elements to each of the halfedges to be accurate to how they would look after the edge is flipped.
		The last step was to then take all of the elements in this mesh that aren't halfedges and set their halfedge pointers
		to a correct halfedge.  
		<p>An example of using edge flips is shown below.</p>

		In general, throughout Parts 4, 5, and 6, the meme of Sheldon above basically describes my entire debugging experience in all parts.
		During the course of writing this code, I was able to avoid too much errors and debugging by following the steps given by the project specs. 
		With that being said, I encountered trouble when first writing this code and when I was still getting familiar with implementing things with halfedges,
		leading to issues where I was not being careful enough with accounting for all mesh elements. In specific, I didn't define some of the relevant halfedges,
		which resulted in incorrect meshes where the neighbors of halfedges were not reset properly. 
		<a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">The guide linked here</a> helped me a ton
		by making sure I really got every mesh element and updated everything properly (I found this guide from the HW2 Part 4 Ed discussion thread).
		
		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		To edge split, I followed the same procedure as edge flipping, just with more details involved. In this case, I had to define one new vertex, 
		two new faces, three new edges, and six new halfedges that would exist after the split. Then, I proceeded in the same way as in edge flipping, 
		first keeping track of all the mesh elements neighboring the edge to be split, creating the new elements, and then taking the new elements and the 
		original mesh elements and setting neighbors and halfedge pointers as appropriate. Interestingly enough, initially, it seemed like performing edge split required less debugging
		and overall time to do than the edge flip now that I was aware that I had to be more careful and think more about every element involved. However,
		there was actually a bug that I didn't realize was an error until Part 6, and I used up a lot of time in Part 6 wondering why my upsampling was not working 
		when I realized that it was actually because I had not set up my halfedge pointers for the edges properly, leading to some edges not having the correct 
		halfedge associated with it. 
		<p>The images below show an example of doing edge splits.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		To upsample, I followed the recommended steps from the project spec. First, I calculated the new positions of the existing vertices in the mesh and stored
		them in vertex->newPosition. Then, I calculated the new positions of the vertices that we will eventually add and stored them in edge->newPosition, where 
		edge is the edge that the new vertex will lie on. To get these new positions, I used the formulas described in the project spec, traversing the mesh as necessary to get the vertices/values required. Then, I split the edges and set the created vertex's new position to be the correspodning
		edge's new position. Then, I flipped any edge that connected an old and new vertex. Lastly, since we have defined and calculated all new positions
		of both old and new vertices, I updated the position of every vertex in the mesh. 

		<p>
			As mentioned in Part 5, I spent quite a bit of time debugging Part 6 because even though I felt that I was going through every part of this process very 
			carefully, it still seemed that my loop subdivision was not looking correct. By commenting out certain later steps and testing each step one by one, I realized
			that the edge splitting step always seemed to look a little off. I eventually realized that I had actually done Part 5 incorrectly, causing issues with
			Part 6. After fixing my halfedge pointer issues as mentioned above, Part 6 also worked. 
		</p>

		<p>Running this code a couple of times, I observed that loop subdivision made a visible improvement to the smoothness of a surface. For example, 
			the below picture shows how a torus goes from blocky to smooth and rounded. The sharp corners and edges round out to form a continuous surface 
			the more loop subdivision iterations you do.
		</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>Upsampled three times</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p></p>
		It's also interesting to note that splitting edges before loop subdivision can produce noticeably different results and change the overall shape. If the shape 
		is perfectly symmetrical and then an edge is split, the loop subdivision will further emphasize asymmetry or add sharp points/corners. This is shown below in the 
		image of the torus, but with a few edges split.
		<p></p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <figcaption>Upsampled three times, not a perfect torus</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p></p>
		Likewise, it seems that smartly splitting edges can change sharp corners or edges into a smooth surface or make surfaces more symmetrical. This is shown 
		with the cube below. The initial cube, when loop subdivision is applied, would look like this:
		<p></p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part6/cube/Part6_cube0.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Original cube</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part6/cube/Part6_cube1.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Upsampled one time</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part6/cube/Part6_cube2.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Upsampled two times</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part6/cube/Part6_cube3.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Upsampled three times</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p></p>
		If we split every edge running across each face of the cube, we can create a symmetrical shape, which will make the final upsampled image symmetrical.
		<p></p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part6/cube/Part6_cubesplit0.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Cube with split edges</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part6/cube/Part6_cubesplit1.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Upsampled three times</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p></p>
		The pre-processing matters because without it, we are rounding out the vertices on each face that don't have a diagonal edge running through it more than the vertices
		that have a diagonal running through it. Since they round out faster, we end up with cases where there are pointy parts where the vertices that had a diagonal running through it were. 
		With pre-processing, we can ensure that every vertex has the same degree, and therefore will be affected equally by loop subdivision rather than having some round out more than others.
