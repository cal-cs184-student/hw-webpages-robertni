		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I learned to create a realistic simulation of a cloth. In part 1, we set up our cloth as a basic mesh of point masses interconnected 
		with a system of springs to correlate the forces between different point masses. In part 2, I created a basic simulation of a cloth interacting with 
		different forces by integrating across the various forces acting on a point mass and using that to determine the acceleration and movement of each 
		point within the cloth. In parts 3 and 4, I resolved issues with collisions to prevent point masses from overlapping with each other or other objects 
		in a scene. In part 5, I added shaders to create a variety of different textures and lighting styles on objects and cloths.
		<p>Overall, what I found most interesting in this homework assignment was learning how to decompose a seemingly daunting task of 
			simulating a falling cloth into something that is quite simple. From this homework, and previous homeworks, I've realized how 
			important it is to just break down a large object or task into smaller units that you can work easily with, and then build up from 
			there. In this case, to simulate a cloth, we had to look at singular point masses within the cloth and model how each of those point masses 
			are affected by the forces on them individually.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		In this section, I built a grid made of point masses and connecting springs. Three examples are shown here:
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

					<img src="Part1/onlyshear.png" width="200px"/>
					<figcaption>Only shearing constraints</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		In this part, we made a simple simulation of how a cloth would fall using integration methods, adding up external forces like gravity and 
		forces from internal spring-like interactions between points in the cloth. I yielded this initial result from doing the simulation using 
		a spring constant of 5000 N/m, a density of 15 g/cm^3, and a damping of 0.2. This is shown here:
		<figure>
			<img src="Part2/original.png" alt="cloth_pin2" style="width:70%"/>
			<figcaption>ks=5000, density=15, damping=0.2</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Changing the spring constant ks seems to cause changes to how 'loose' the cloth looks. This is shown in the two images below. A lower spring 
			constant indicates a spring between two points that is less stiff, which allows the cloth to droop down looser. Additionally, in the process 
			of falling, having a lower spring constant seems to prevent the cloth from rebounding as much as with a higher spring constant, where there is a 
			visible slow rebound from a lowest state.
		</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part2/low_ks.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low spring constant (500 N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Part2/high_ks.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>High spring constant (50000 N/m)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			Changing density seems to also affect how 'loose' the cloth looks. When a cloth is more dense, it will naturally droop more, since 
			there is a greater gravitational force at any point (assuming that the cloth's size is not changing). 
		</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>

				  <img src="Part2/low_dens.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low density (5 g/cm^3)</figcaption>

				  <img src="Part2/high_dens.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>High density (30 g/cm^3)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			Changing damping has a large effect on how fast/dramatically the cloth falls. When the cloth has 0 damping, it will swing crazily back and forth 
			as shown in the image below, whereas when the cloth has higher damping, it will fall slowly and react less to the various forces on it, moving as 
			one uniform sheet for the most part.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		To handle collisions with spheres, I first checked the distance from the point mass to the center of the sphere. If the distance is less than 
		the radius of the sphere, then adjustments for collision need to be made. From there, I find where the intersection of the point mass with the 
		surface of the sphere should be if we extend the vector from the origin of the sphere to the current point mass location backwards to the surface of the 
		sphere. The vector from the last position of the point mass to the tangent point is used as the correction vector from the last position, scaled 
		down for frictional forces. 
		<p>
			To handle collisions with planes, I first used a test similar to what we did with point-in-triangle testing, calculating L = V*N and checking if 
			L of the last position and the current position have the same sign. IF they are not the same sign, then a collision has occurred. To find the tangent point 
			like done so with spheres, I found the projection of the vector from the given plane point to the current point mass location on the plane. I then 
			create a correction vector similarly to with a sphere. 
		</p>
		<p>Below are three examples of collisions with a sphere varying by the spring constant of the cloth. We can see that increasing ks 
			creates a cloth that retains its shape a little better instead of falling straight down. The high spring constant cloth looks less 'droopy' in the images below.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		To handle self-collisions, I first needed to create a spatial hashing of the point masses, partitioning them into boxes of width 
		3 * width / num_width_points, height 3 * height / num_height_points, and depth max(w, h). Then, for any given point mass being checked, 
		we find the box it would be partitioned into, and check the distance of other point masses within that partition to the input point 
		mass. If the distance is less than 2 * thickness, we need to adjust for self-collision. We can calculate correction vectors for all the 
		neighboring point masses that collide with the input point mass such that the correction would make the distance be 2 * thickness, and 
		then correct the input point mass location by the average correction vector. 
		<p>Below is an example of a cloth falling with self-collision implemented.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<p>
			Density can affect how self-collision occurs. In specific, having a lower density seems to lead to larger folds, whereas a high density 
			seems to lead to smaller, tighter folds.

			Spring constant also affects self-collisions. Having a lower spring constant seems to lead to tighter, smaller folds whereas 
			a higher spring constant seems to lead to larger folds.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		A shader program is a system that allows a computer to more efficiently output various types of coloring and shading to objects in 
		graphics. Vertex shaders take each vertex in the scene and perform transformations on them. Fragment shaders take the outputs of vertex 
		shaders and fragments that result from rasterization and produce colors for the fragments. Vertex and fragment shaders work together 
		to ultimately do what we were doing in Homework 3, where we see how light rays interact with vertices in some scene object and perform 
		transformations/calculations on the light in order to produce different textures and lighting. 
		<p>
			Blinn-Phong shading is a model of shading that combines three basic components of lighting in a scene: ambient light, diffuse light, 
			and specular light. By calculating these three components at a given vertex from the incoming light, we can yield some amount of light 
			reflected out from that vertex. The images below depict the components of Blinn Phong shading. 
		</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<p>We can also create shaders based on different textures, essentially wrapping the texture around the cloth and sphere.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Bumps and displacement can also be added to texturize the objects. Bump and displacement mapping are shown below. 
			The two shading methods are similar in being able to create a rougher/textured appearance. However, it appears that displacement 
			mapping yields a more dramatic result especially when looking at the edges of the images, where there are clear ridges in the 
			surface of the objects. Bump mapping is a little more subtle, relying mainly on the lighting to create detail instead of the actual 
			position of vertices along the object surface.

		<p>Lastly, we can also create a mirror effect on our object by taking the outgoing light samples hitting the camera and 
			reflect them back across surfaces of intersection.
